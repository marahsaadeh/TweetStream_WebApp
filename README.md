## Installation

To set up the project, open the terminal (command interface) and follow these steps:

1. Copy the project to your computer with this command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/marahsaadeh/TweetStream_WebApp.git
   ```
2. Move to the main folder of the project:
   ```
   cd <folder name>
   ```
3. To install needed packages for the project, use npm (Node.js package manager) to install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   Or shorter:
   ```
   npm i
   ```

   This command installs all packages listed in `package.json` file. It makes sure the development environment matches the project needs.

## Running the Project

To start the project in development mode, use this command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command runs the development server on `localhost` with Hot Module Replacement (HMR). It lets you see changes in the code directly without reloading the page manually.
